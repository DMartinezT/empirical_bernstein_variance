# Sharp empirical Bernstein bounds for the variance

Implementation of the experiments shown in the paper Sharp empirical Bernstein bounds for the variance. 

## Structure

The repository contains 
- Python scripts, which contain the working code of the experiments. 
- Python notebooks, which make use of the scripts to make the plots displayed in the paper. 

## Scripts

**main.py** runs the main simulations of the project. 

**variance_estimation.py** contains the implementation of the proposed upper and lower bounds. 
**alternative_variance_estimation.py** contains the implementation of alternative upper and lower bounds.
**experiment_params.py** contains the parameters of the simulations.


## Notebooks

**read_variance.ipynb** plots the three figures of the paper.
